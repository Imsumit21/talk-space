## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Glassmorphism design language chosen to differentiate from Gather.town's pixel art style (Modern, depth-rich aesthetic)
- Inter + Space Grotesk fonts selected for clean modern typography with good readability (free, good web font loading)

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

- Phase 1 must establish design tokens BEFORE any component work to prevent inconsistency
- Phase 3 has highest PixiJS integration risk (texture memory leaks, batching issues) requiring continuous GPU monitoring
- Phase 5 must handle keyboard capture conflicts (chat input vs WASD movement keys)
- Phase 6 performance target is non-negotiable: 60fps with 30+ avatars for 10+ minutes continuous
